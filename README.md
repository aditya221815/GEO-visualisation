# GEO-visualisation
A basic analysis of BigData on the spread of COVID-19 in the world.  Make predictions based on linear regression, obtain statistics and create interactive maps showing the dynamics of the virus spread. 

# Introduction
There is a lot of open data about the spread of COVID-19 in the world. However, few tools are presented to predict and visualize these processes. This laboratory work will show how you can download data from open sources, perform preliminary data analysis, transform and clear data, perform correlation and lag analysis.

Next, we will consider 2 different mathematical approaches to the calculation of a forecast based on linear regression.

To do this, the division of the DataSet into training and test sets will be demonstrated. It will be shown how to build models using 2 different frameworks. Then we will build a forecast and analyze the accuracy and adequacy of the obtained models.

At the end of the laboratory work, we will visualize the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread on interactive maps.
